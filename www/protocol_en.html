                <br>
                <br>
            (1) We provides distributed services due to the distributed nature of the blockchain. We cannot control the blockchain network, which is greatly different from banking financial institutions. You should fully understand and agree that we cannot provide the following services:
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Store your wallet password (the password set when the you creates/imports the wallet), private key, and mnemonic;
                </li>
                <li>

            </ul>
            (2) You should keep your own mobile devices with Rainbow Wallet, backup Rainbow Wallet, backup wallet password, and mnemonic. If the user loses the mobile device, deletes and does not back up the Rainbow Wallet, the wallet is stolen or you forget the wallet password and the mnemonic, we are unable to restore the wallet or retrieve the wallet password, private key and mnemonic; If the user mishandles the transaction (for example, the wrong payment address), we cannot cancel the transaction.

            <br>
            (4) Rainbow Wallet is only a Token management tool, not an exchange or trading platform. Although this Agreement will refer to “transactions” many times, it refers to the send, delegate, undelegate, redelegate, withdraw rewards operations performed by the user using Rainbow Wallet, which is essentially different from the “transaction” conducted on the exchange or trading platform. We do not own, control or operate these networks, and therefore cannot guarantee that any transactions submitted through our services will be confirmed and processed because of the network characteristic of blockchain. With Rainbow Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction you submitted may not be completed by the blockchain network or may be significantly delayed.
            <br>
